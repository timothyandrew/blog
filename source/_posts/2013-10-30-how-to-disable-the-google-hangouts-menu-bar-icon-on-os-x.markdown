This has been annoying me for weeks now. Google Hangouts would place an menu-bar icon for each instance of Chrome I had running. Repeatedly quitting them didn't have much effect; they'd keep coming back.

Luckily, there's an easy way to turn off the menu-bar icons.

- Open Chrome
- Menu Bar > Chrome > Preferences
- Click on Extensions, scroll down to Hangouts, and click on *Options*
- Uncheck *Show system tray icon*
- Click *OK*

And that's it.
